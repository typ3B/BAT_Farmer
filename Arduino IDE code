/* This code was developed by anythingbutasic for the atmega32u4 arduino micro/Leonardo.. Flash this code onto your microcontroller and put you mouse 
 *   curser over your main brave browser search bar. 5 secs after it should click the url search bar and start typing urls into you search box. Make 
 *   sure you have brave rewards enabled and a wallet setup. Its is unfortuanate that unless you become a brave certified creator you will have to
 *   use either uphold or Gemini to collect you reward through their exchange atm. This is a beta code ant not all of it will work for all OS. This
 *   code will be in further development as the developer figures out the limits on the brave browsers rewards. Note you are getting wBAT and not
 *   real BAT which is why you have to cliam these at an exchange or donate them. */
